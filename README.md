# pardisc
This is the repository for pardisc (lowercase), a Discord bot for the party games you can't do because you're not in the same place. This README is "under construction" (meaning, I don't know if I'm going to share this repo with anyone else, so I don't know if I need it), so things might be weird, but hopefully fixed in future commits.

## Things

* Limit line length to 100 characters.
* There is a GitHub Actions pipeline planned for code review and automatic analysis. I don't know exactly how that works, so it might take a while. It'll include black, pylint, and bandit. (Currently working on this! This README edit is kind of a test commit for this, too.)
* Automated unit tests will be difficult for a Discord bot, because you need to separate the logic from the command structure. Most likely, I'll post an issue and it'll be marked as nonessential.

> Okay bye.
