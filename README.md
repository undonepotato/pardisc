# pardisc
This is the repository for pardisc (lowercase), a Discord bot for the party games you can't do because you're not in the same place. This README is "under construction" (meaning, I don't know if I'm going to share this repo with anyone else, so I don't know if I need it), so things might be weird, but hopefully fixed in future commits.

For now: Line length should be limited to 90, run black on all Python files, and hope that this project gets finished.

> Okay bye.
